# TODO
- Show only the most recent roll by default (fixed to bottom)
- Clicking on expand can bring up all recent rolls
- scrollable recent rolls with fixed height

(New) (Edit/Save) (d20) (1d4+1 + 1d4+1 + 1d4+1)
- clicking (New) enters selector mode

- keep list of built rolls
- start with a default `d20` roll
- clicking a roll causes it to be rolled

- hovering mouse over dice during selection
  - shows dice type in gray text (as if about to add)
  - clearly shows clicking would add to dice notation
