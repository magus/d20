Next renders on both the server and client, therefore the integration with React Intl becomes more involved than with a client-only app.

- Server-side language negotiation
- React Intl locale data loading via `pages/_document.js` customization
- React Intl integration at Next page level via `pageWithIntl()` HOC
- `<IntlProvider>` creation with `locale`, `messages`, and `initialNow` props
- Default message extraction via `babel-plugin-react-intl` integration
- Translation management via build script and customized Next server

## Translation Management
This app uses the `lang/` dir (which will show up after running the build script). This dir has `.messages/` subdir which is where React Intl's Babel plugin outputs the default messages it extracts. The default messages (`en.json` in this example app) is also generated by the build script. This file can then be sent to a translation service to perform localization for the other locales the app should support.

The translated messages files that exist at `lang/*.json` are only used during production, and are automatically provided to the `<IntlProvider>`. During development the `defaultMessage`s defined in the source code are used. To prepare the example app for localization and production run the build script and start the server in production mode:

```
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```
